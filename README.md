# Use The Force
My faculty project for the class of soft computing.

### What does it do?
It detects hand motion using a webcam, and moves mouse cursor
accordingly. Also, it can perform left/right mouse button press and release 
depending on hand gestures.

Of course, it is **not** perfect (performance is really bad :) ), as it is only supposed to be an introduction to artifical nerual networks and computer vision. I will work on it more (when I get enough time) for improvements, and also make a non-neural network version (will probably use feature matching). 

### Requirements
* Hand(s)
* Webcam, *or any other cam that can be attached to and used by PC*
* Python 2.7
* Libraries:
    * OpenCV2
    * Keras
    * Theano
    * PyAutoGui
