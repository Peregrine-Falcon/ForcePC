# Use The Force
My faculty project for the class of soft computing.

### What does it do?
It detects hand motion using a webcam, and moves mouse cursor
accordingly. Also, it can perform left/right mouse button press and release 
depending on hand gestures.

Of course, it is **not** perfect, as it is only supposed to be an introduction to artifical nerual networks and computer vision.

### Requirements
* Hand(s)
* Webcam, *or any other cam that can be attached to and used by PC*
* Python 2.7
* Libraries:
    * OpenCV2
    * Keras
    * Theano
    * PyAutoGui
